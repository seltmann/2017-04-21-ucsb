# What is a database?

A database is a way to store and manipulate information. Databases are arranged as tables. Each table has columns (also known as fields) that describe the data, and rows (also known as records) which contain the data.

When we are using a spreadsheet, we put formulas into cells to calculate new values based on old ones. When we are using a database, we send commands (usually called queries) to a database manager: a program that manipulates the database for us. The database manager does whatever lookups and calculations the query specifies, returning the results in a tabular form that we can then use as a starting point for further queries.

# What is a relational database?

A collection of data organized into tables and those tables contain values that relate one table to another.

# What is SQL?

It is a database manager. Every database manager — Oracle, IBM DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft Access, and ***SQLite*** — stores data in a different way, so a database created with one cannot be used directly by another. However, every database manager can import and export data in a variety of formats, like .csv, so it is possible to move information from one to another.

# Benefits of relational databases

Both relational databases and spreadsheets are used to store and manipulate data.

relational DB | spreadsheets|
---------------|---------------|
handle more data | slow down quickly|
develop open science practices | difficult to follow methods|
easy to version | easy to loose data|

# Getting Started:

We are going to learn the basics of SQL using ***SQLite*** using data frames. You can think of a data frame as if they were tables in a relational database. We can do this with sqldf package.

***

## `data`
For this section, let's first start by:

- create a new folder for our **sqldf** lesson in our ~/Desktop/workshop folder

- **cp** the mammal_stats.csv file into the sqldf folder or [download the data here](../data/mammal_stats.csv)

***
Check your working directory, make a new folder called sqldf

    setwd("~/Desktop/workshop/sqldf")
    
    getwd()

***
- create a new R file called **sqldf-lesson.R** and save it into the sqldf folder

- commit your changes to github!

***
Clear that working memory...

    rm(list = ls())


***

sqldf is a powerful R package that allows 1) the use of SQLite syntax to be used directly on data frames, and 2) can create mini-SQLlite databases.

Here's how to install sqldf:

    install.packages("sqldf", dependencies = TRUE)  
    library("sqldf")

***

# Reading and looking at your data frame using SQL.

First, read in the data frame as we did before using **read.csv**

    mammals <- read.csv("mammal_stats.csv", header=TRUE)
    
    head(mammals)
    
***TIP*** header: logical: should the data frame use the first row as headers?

***

## Selecting values

R gives you lots of ways to look at your data frame.

    head(mammals)
    tail(mammals)
    ncol(mammals)
    View(mammals)
    
SQLite gives you more ways with Select. Select statements using SQLite * indicates selecting all columns.

    sqldf("select * from mammals limit 10")

***
**Select** distinct values in rows.

    sqldf("select distinct `order` from mammals")
    
    sqldf("select distinct `order`,species from mammals")


***TIP*** The word ***order*** is a column name, but it is also a command reserved in SQL. Put column names in `` to avoid confusion.

***

**Select** using filters

    sqldf("select * from mammals where `order`='Carnivora'")
    
    sqldf("select `order`, species from mammals where `order`='Carnivora'")
    
***

**Select** using limits and ordering

    sqldf("select * from mammals where `order`='Carnivora' limit 3")
    
    sqldf("select * from mammals where `order`='Carnivora' order by adult_body_mass_g desc limit 10")

***TIP*** The opposite of desc is **asc**

***

**Select** based on wildcard searching.

    sqldf("select * from  mammals `order` where species like 'Canis%'")

***
**Select** and change column name

    sqldf("select distinct `order` as taxonOrder from mammals")
    
***
**Select** all where litter_size is not NA

    sqldf("select * from mammals where litter_size is not null limit 10")
    
***

> **Exercise 1**:
> Select unique species with litter_size less than 1

***

**Save** your output to a new data frame
    
    mammalsEdited <-  sqldf("select `order` as taxonOrder, species, adult_body_mass_g as mass from mammals")
    
    head(mammalsEdited)

***
**Concatenation**

    sqldf("select taxonOrder || '-' || species as name from mammalsEdited limit 10")

***
**Remove** white space

    taxonString <- sqldf("select species, taxonOrder || '-' || replace(species,' ','-') as name from mammalsEdited limit 10")
    
    head(taxonString)

***
Counting using SQLite by **Groups** and then making quick and simple bar plots

    numberSpecies <- sqldf("select count(species) as cnt,taxonOrder from mammalsEdited group by taxonOrder order by cnt desc")
    
    head(numberSpecies) 
    
    par(las=2) # make label text perpendicular to axis
    par(mar=c(8,8,3,2)) # increase y-axis margin
    barplot(log(numberSpecies$cnt), names.arg=numberSpecies$taxonOrder)


***
Finding **maximum** and **minimum**

    sqldf("select max(adult_body_mass_g) from mammals")
    
    sqldf("select min(adult_body_mass_g) from mammals")
    
    sqldf("select * from mammals where adult_body_mass_g = (select max(adult_body_mass_g) from mammals)")
 
*** 
SQLite has a lot of built in [functions](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html) that can help with processing numbers or text. 

Some particularly helpful ones are: ***trim()***, ***upper()***, ***round()***, and ***random()***

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg/220px-Function_machine2.svg.png" height="200px" align="middle"  />

*** 
> **Exercise 2**:
> Use the upper() function to output the taxonOrder names in mammalsEdited all in uppercase. Write the output to a new data frame.

***

# Advanced methods sqldf() 

We have come far! Now, lets figure out how to do more complex actions in SQLite using sqldf.

***
# Joining data frames

Let's make the merge in a way we can select values from 2 different data frames and put them together in a new data frame

    mammalCounts <- sqldf("select count(*) as orderTotal, species from mammals group by `order`")

    sqldf("select count(*) from mammals where `order` = 'Afrosoricida'")
    
	head(mammalCounts)
    
    sqlJoinMammalsCount <- sqldf("select * from mammals join mammalCounts on mammals.species = mammalCounts.species")

	head(sqlJoinMammalsCount)

***TIP*** Notice species is now in the  data frame twice! Why?
    
    sqlJoinMammalsCount <- sqldf("select mammals.*,mammalCounts.orderTotal from mammals join mammalCounts on mammals.species=mammalCounts.species")
    head(sqlJoinMammalsCount)
    
***

# Update and Delete values from a data frame

Update a data frame by merging and overwriting the first  data frame

    sql1 <- "update sqlJoinMammalsCount set `order`='Primates' where species='Dromiciops gliroides'"
    
    sql2 <- "select * from sqlJoinMammalsCount"
    
   sqlJoinMammalsCount <- sqldf(c(sql1, sql2))

sqldf(select * from sqlJoinMammalsCount where `order`='Primates')
    
***
Delete values

    sqlJoinMammalsCount <- sqldf(c("delete from sqlJoinMammalsCount where `order`='Dermoptera'", "select * from sqlJoinMammalsCount"))

    head(sqlJoinMammalsCount)
    
***
Insert a value

    sqlJoinMammalsCount <- sqldf(c("insert into sqlJoinMammalsCount values (1,'Primates','New primate', 55.00,'',134,2,4)","select * from sqlJoinMammalsCount"))

    head(sqlJoinMammalsCount)
    
    sqldf("select * from sqlJoinMammalsCount where species='New Primate'")
    
    *** 
> **Exercise 3**:
> Insert a new record where litter size is NA, home range=134km, and body mass=55g)

***TIP*** NA is NULL in SQL

# What we did not cover so far

We covered basic syntax of sql using SQLite syntax on data frames without actually creating a database. We did not cover creating a relational database or executing commands in conjunction with a database.
